# Dependent Graph Releaser
Dependent Graph Releaser is a tool which helps you with releasing a project and its dependent projects.
Its aim is to simplify the process of using up-to-date internal dependencies.
 
A simple example: having project `A -> B -> C` we want to automate the following process:
- release C
- update the dependency in B
- release B
- update the dependency in A
- release A

It will start of with supporting only maven projects and requires Jenkins integration.

Have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/loewenfels/dep-graph-releaser/wiki) 
for more information and try out the [online example](https://loewenfels.github.io/dep-graph-releaser/#./release.json).

# Key Features
- Release pipeline based on dependencies (no need to adopt your pipeline if a dependency changes)
- Dry Run included
- The flexible process design lets you use Dependent Graph Releaser as supportive tool which does not constrict you.
- Interact with the process to fix failing releases before the release process as a whole has ended.
- Integration of multiple jenkins instances possible (e.g. eases the migration from Jenkins 1.x to 2.x)
   
# Design Decisions   
- In case a dependency has specified `${project.version}` as `<version>` then it will be replaced with the new version.
