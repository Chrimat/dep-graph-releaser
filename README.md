# Dependent Graph Releaser
Dependent Graph Releaser is a tool which helps you with releasing a project and its dependent projects.

It will start of with supporting only maven projects and requires Jenkins integration.
More information will follow...

You can also use it to get an HTML which represents a Pipeline showing you, how you would need to release the projects 
manually. It generates kind of a bottom up dependency graph, or in other words a dependents graph. 

Add the projects you want to analyse the folder `repos` (in the project directory) and run the following gradle command:
````
gr html -Pg=your.group.id -Pa=the.artifact.id
````
This creates a `pipeline.html` in the folder build.
